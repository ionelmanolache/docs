Vitest is a JavaScript unit testing framework. It was created to complement Vite, a tool for helping to manage and build JavaScript-based Web applications.


Vitest is similar to Jest,  but its main distinguishing characteristic is speed and (when used in conjunction with Vite) simplicity.

Automated E2E testing, which involves opening a browser, navigating to web pages, and interacting with web elements, can be slow because these tests rely heavily on the network.

if you introduce frequent changes to your application's UI, writing automated E2E tests that rely on the UI components can be futile and inefficient because you'll have to redo your automation. Moreover, you shouldn't automate tests that aren't deterministic (i.e., testing a Captcha) because your automation code needs predictable results to produce a pass-fail condition.
